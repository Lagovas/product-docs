## AcraBlock

### Container structure

AcraBlock is a container format. Acra uses an envelope encryption strategy: plaintext data is encrypted using data encryption key (DEK), and then DEK is encrypted using key encryption key (KEK). AcraBlock uses AES-GCM for both encryption procedures.

AcraBlock supports key rotation: it's possible to rotate only KEK without re-encrypting the data (known as "key rotation without data re-encryption"), or re-encrypt data and rotate both keys ("key rotation with data re-encryption").

To generate AcraBlocks Acra-Server uses symmetric keys generated for every ClientID/ZoneID.

`AcraBlock = Begin_Tag + Rest_AcraBlock_Length + Key_Encryption_Backend_Identifier + Key_Encryption_Key_ID + Data_Encryption_Backend_Identifier + Data_Encryption_Key_Length + Encrypted_Data_Encryption_Key + Encrypted_Data`
* `Begin_Tag[4]` - 4 bytes, header tag. Contains 4 bytes with byte value = 34: [34, 34, 34, 34].
* `Rest_AcraBlock_Length[8]` - 8 bytes in Little-Endian byte order that store length of whole AcraBlock excluding length of Begin_Tag.
* `Key_Encryption_Backend_Identifier[1]` - identifier of encryption backend used to encrypt DEK which is random symmetric key. For now AcraBlock supports only one backend that uses Themis Secure Cell in Seal mode with identifier `0` and may be changed.
* `Key_Encryption_Key_ID[2]` - this field stores KEK's identifier. Main goal of this ID is to simplify search of KEK in a keychain related to specific ClientID/ZoneID. Now Acra-Server generates ID by hashing with `SHA256(KEK || ClientID/ZoneID)` and uses first 2 bytes as ID.
* `Data_Encryption_Backend_Identifier[1]` -  identifier of encryption backend used to encrypt plaintext. For now AcraBlock supports only one backend that uses Themis Secure Cell in Seal mode with identifier `0`. Same as for DEK encryption and may be changed too.
* `Data_Encryption_Key_Length[2]` - 2 bytes of DEK's length in Little-Endian byte order. Key size should be synchronized with data encryption backend.
* `Encrypted_Data_Encryption_Key[*]` - encrypted DEK of size `Data_Encryption_Key_Length`, used to encrypt data and data encryption backend. For each new AcraBlock Acra-Server generates new random DEK and encrypts with DEK encryption backend and Context (ClientID/ZoneID).
* `Encrypted_Data[*]` encrypted data with data encryption backend and random DEK.

### Generating

To generate AcraBlock in transparent mode Acra-Server performs following steps:
* Generates new random DEK for default data encryption backend. DEK length is 32 bytes.
* Encrypts plaintext with DEK and Context of specified ClientID/ZoneID using default backend for data encryption.
* Securely cleans up memory of plaintext data (erases/fills with zeros).
* Encrypts DEK with KEK from KeyStore for specified ClientID/ZoneID and use it as Context.
* Securely cleans up memory of DEK (erases/fills with zeros).
* Forms a container: packs together Begin_Tag, length of all other parts, KEK encryption backend identifier, KEK identifier, data encryption backend identifier, encrypted DEK and ciphertext.

### Decrypting

* Validate Begin_Tag.
* Validate length of rest of AcraBlock.
* Extract KEK backend identifier and validate, check that this identifier is registered in Acra-Server.
* Extract data encryption backend identifier and validate, check that this identifier is registered in Acra-Server.
* Extract length of DEK.
* Extract DEK.
* Iterate over KEKs (passed from KeyStore) for decryption and search correct for DEK decryption.
* Decrypt DEK with correct KEK.
* Erase/fill with zeros memory area of the KEK.
* Decrypt data with decrypted DEK.
* Erase/fill with zeros memory area of the DEK.

## AcraStruct
### Understanding AcraStruct

AcraStruct is a cryptographic container with specific format. Before generating each AcraStruct, AcraWriter generates a keypair of throwaway keys that are used in the encryption process and then get zeroed (turned into zeros) in the memory once the process is over.

```AcraStruct = Begin_Tag + Throwaway_Public_Key + Encrypted_Random_Key + Data_Length + Encrypted_Data```

- `Begin_Tag[8]` — 8 bytes, header tag (can be changed);
- `Throwaway_Public_Key[45]` — temporary public key generated by AcraWriter;
- `Encrypted_Random_Key[84]` — encrypted Random Key by using SMessage (see next);
- `Data_Length[8]` — length of the Encrypted data (see next);
- `Encrypted_Data[Data_Length]` — payload encrypted with Random Key.

### Generating AcraStruct

AcraWriter is used to generate AcraStruct, but the generation process is quite simple and can be implemented in any custom writer:

- AcraWriter generates a keypair of throwaway keys using Themis EC key generator:<br/>
  `Throwaway_Keypair = (Throwaway_Public_Key, Throwaway_Private_Key)`.
- Generates Random Symmetric Key (`RK`), 32 bytes long.
- Encrypts `RK` using [Secure Message](/pages/secure-message-cryptosystem/) with `Throwaway_Private_Key` and `Acra_Public_Key`(or Zone key – see [Zones](/pages/documentation-acra/#zones)):<br/>
  `Encrypted_Random_Key = SMessage(RK, Throwaway_Private_Key, Acra_Public_Key)`.
- Encrypts the payload with [Secure Cell](/pages/secure-cell-cryptosystem/) in Seal mode:<br/>
  `Encrypted_Data = SCell(RK, payload)`.
- Erases/fills with zeros memory area of the `RK`.
- Calculates the encrypted payload length and transforms it into little endian 8 bytes long (`Data_Length`).
- Connects attributes together as described in the original formula.
- Erases/fills with zeros the memory area containing the `Throwaway_Keypair` and original payload.

We recommend you to check out AcraStruct [examples](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/tree/master/examples) and try the [⚙️Acra Engineering Demo⚙️](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo/#what-is-this).

### Decrypting AcraStruct

AcraServer, upon receiving and detecting valid AcraStruct, is able to:

- Extract Throwaway Public Key (`TPK`).
- Decrypt asymmetric envelope with `TPK` and Acra's Private Key (or [Zone key](/pages/documentation-acra/#client-side-with-zones)).
- Extract Random Key (`RK`) for Secure Cell container out of a decrypted envelope;
- Decrypt Secure Cell, extract payload;
- Reconstruct database answer in such a way that AcraStruct is replaced by decrypted data.

Check implementation in [decryptor/base/utils.go](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/blob/master/decryptor/base/utils.go#L29).

### Zone Ids

Although not directly related to AcraStructs, Zone Ids are used for matching Zones to keys. The current format is 8 bytes "begin tag" + 16 symbols a-zA-Z.

## Storage Models

There are two storage model modes used in Acra: WholeCell and InjectedCell.

In WholeCell mode, [AcraStruct](/pages/documentation-acra/#acrastruct) represents a complete piece of data (i.e. database cell, a file, or some data transmitted into [AcraTranslator](/pages/acratranslator/)). In this mode it is expected that the encrypted data will look something like:

1. `<AcraStruct>`,
2. `<AcraStruct>`,
3. `<AcraStruct>`.

In InjectedCell mode, AcraStruct is stored inside some piece of data, i.e. inside some file or in a database cell with a file inside, with AcraStruct as a piece of that file, not the whole file. In this mode, the encrypted data will look something like this:

1. `<Some AcraStruct data, some other AcraStruct data>`,
2. `<AcraSctruct>`,
3. `<File containing AcraStruct alongside other data>`.

The main difference between these modes is performance. In the WholeCell mode, AcraStructs are simply decrypted. In InjectedCell mode, [AcraServer](/pages/documentation-acra/#server-side-acraserver) needs to find AcraStructs inside some other data element first and then decrypt them, which takes obviously take longer. The process of searching for the necessary piece of data takes place as the data is going through Acra. Acra will look for AcraStructs in every piece of data in InjectedCell mode.

Which mode should you choose?

Let’s consider an example where we’re storing an email in a database and we’d like to encrypt it, “wrapping” it into an AcraStruct. We’d get a table:

| Email        | Column 2     | Column 3     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| <AcraStruct> | Column2Value | Column3Value |
| <AcraStruct> | Column2Value | Column3Value |

In this case, an AcraStruct takes up a whole cell and we are trying to decrypt it as is, without searching for anything.
But things can be different. In InjectedCell mode a binary [MsgPack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) or [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) could be stored in a table, and it is possible that in those data entities only one field is encrypted.

Such data entity wouldn’t be a single AcraStruct - it would be a data entity that contains an AcraStruct or several AcraStructs. This means that in the InjectedCell mode we stop assuming that the database cells can only contain complete AcraStructs. AcraStructs can be inside some other pieces of data and that’s where we’re starting to look for them. This consequently slows down the processing speed. However, not every task needs the InjectedCell mode, which is why one can switch between modes, depending on what you’re encrypting and how you’re storing it.

By default, the WholeCell mode is active (`--acrastruct_wholecell_enable`). You can switch between the modes using startup parameters:

```
--acrastruct_injectedcell_enable
    Acrastruct may be injected into any place of data cell
--acrastruct_wholecell_enable
    Acrastruct will stored in whole data cell (default true)
```

Also see the [CLI reference](/pages/documentation-acra/#acraserver-cli-reference).

## Acrastruct validator

To decrypt AcraStructs generated by AcraWriter in your application, you can also use our [Acrastruct validator](/simulator/acra/). It works as AcraServer / AcraTranslator and uses private decryption keys.

### Getting started with Acrastruct validator

To use Acrastruct validator, you need to register (or login if you have already registered) using your email address (don't worry, no spam from us):

**1.** Click "Register" in the top right corner of Documentation Server (or skip over to Step 3 if you've already registered).

![](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/files/wiki/Cossack-Labs-Themis-Interactive-Simulator-Login.png)

**2.** Register using your email address and create a password (we're feeling awkward reminding you about it, but you should use a unique strong password, always).

![](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/files/wiki/Cossack-Labs-Themis-Interactive-Simulator-Register.png)

**3.** Login using your password and email address.

### Using Acrastruct validaor

If you don't have access to your AcraServer and private keys, use our keys:

**1.** Copy our AcraServer public key, paste in your AcraWriter, generate AcraStruct. Convert AcraStruct to base64 and paste in the form.
**2.** If you are using Zone, paste ZoneID as well.  
![](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/files/wiki/Acrastruct-validator-our-keys.png)

If you have access to private keys, use your own keys. To enter the mode of using your own keys, click the blue selector switch and make sure it has turned from blue to green:

![](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/files/wiki/Acrastruct-validator-own-keys.png)

**1.** Make sure you have correct keys (public and private storage keypair for encrypting and decrypting data). If you don't have a keypair, use [AcraKeymaker](/pages/documentation-acra/#key-names-and-locations) to generate it.

**2.** Use your public data encryption key in AcraWriter to generate AcraStruct. Convert AcraStruct to base64 and paste into the appropriate form.

> Note that AcraKeymaker encrypts private data decryption key. Paste ACRA_MASTER_KEY (usually placed in AcraServer/AcraTranslator) and private data decryption key (base64).

**3.** If you are using Zone, paste ZoneID as well. Do not forget to use Zone keys instead of data encryption and decryption keys.
